# Todo List
Simple todo list using create-react-app

## Notes
* Considerations around additional functionality include displaying ids, timestamps and sorting but deemed out of scope as this is a rabbit hole when combining with design.
* No additional breakpoints (media queries) for various screen widths have been made due to the subjective design element.
* The app itself is fluid/responsive.
* A required html attribute has been put in place for adding items for simplicity. No action is also a logical behaviour for empty inputs.
